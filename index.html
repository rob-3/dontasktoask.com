    <p>
      Every now and then, in online chat rooms I hang around in, someone pops
      in and says something in the lines of,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="name">Foobar123:</span>
      <p class="message">
        Any Java experts around?
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I understand asking questions like this; you want to make sure you're in
      the right place and that a question is appropriate. I used to ask
      questions like this too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, these sorts of questions are less-than-ideal for a number
      of reasons.
    </p>
    <h2>Gatekeeping</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="name">Foobar123:</span>
      <p class="message">
        Any Java <em>experts</em> around?
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This kind of phrasing excludes some potential question-answerers who don't
      feel confident enough to consider themselves experts, even if they might
      know the answer to your question.
    </p>
    <h2>Laziness</h2>
    <p>
      As a frequent question-answerer, it's frustrating when someone has
      obviously not even tried copy-pasting their issue into Google, and the
      first Stack Overflow post is the solution. If you provide details about
      the issue, like the exact error message and what you have tried so far,
      that shows me that I'm not your first recourse and that you respect my
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would rather spend an hour helping someone who came to me as a last
      resort than spend five minutes on someone who can't even bother to type
      out their actual question.
    </p>
    <h2>What is the actual question?</h2>
    <p>
      But laziness aside, this kind of question doesn't actually move anyone
      closer to helping you with your issue. Even if there is a Java expert,
      ready to help, the first thing they will ask you is "what problem are you
      having?". From a practical standpoint, you're much more likely to get help
      by providing relevant details that might pique the interest of people in
      the chat, rather than asking a vague meta-question as a precursor to
      discussing the actual problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone is better off if you just ask the actual question first. Those
      lurking in the chat will have a better idea if they're equipped to help
      you, and consequently, you're more likely to get a useful response more
      quickly.
    </p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      So, to summarize, don't ask
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="name">Foobar123:</span>
      <p class="message">
        Any Java experts around?
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>but rather</p>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="name">Foobar123:</span>
      <p class="message">
        How do I solve [problem] in Java? I'm trying to [exactly what you're
        trying to do and why]. I've already tried [attempted solution A] and
        [attempted solution B] to no avail.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      and you're likely to get faster, higher-quality responses, and be a breath
      of fresh air to the support community.
